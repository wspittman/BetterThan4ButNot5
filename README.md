# BetterThan4ButNot5: LLM Model Sorting Game

A humorous web-based game that challenges players to sort AI language model names in the correct order based on different criteria. This project highlights the confusion caused by inconsistent naming conventions in the AI industry.

## About the Project

"Model Name Mayhem" is a fun, interactive game where users drag and drop AI model names into the correct order based on different criteria:

- **Release Date Order**: Sort models from earliest to latest release
- **Performance Order**: Sort models from lowest to highest performance
- **Confusion Factor**: Sort models from least to most confusing naming convention

The game demonstrates how difficult it can be to understand the relative positioning of models like "GPT-4", "GPT-4o", "GPT-4 Turbo", "GPT-5 Preview", etc. based on their names alone.

## Play Online

This game is hosted on GitHub Pages at: [https://yourusername.github.io/BetterThan4ButNot5](https://yourusername.github.io/BetterThan4ButNot5)

## How to Play

1. Choose a sorting criterion (Release Date, Performance, or Confusion Factor)
2. Drag the model names from the top container and drop them in the bottom container in what you think is the correct order
3. Click "Check Order" to see if you got it right
4. Click "Reset" to try again
